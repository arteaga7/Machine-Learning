This repository contains the following Machine Learning (ML) projects implementing Scikit-learn library:

1. binary_classifier: The performance of 4 different ML algorithms are compared to solve the binary classification problem. 
Algorithm 1: Logistic Regression. Algorithm 2: Decision Tree Classifier. Algorithm 3: Random Forest Classifier. Algorithm 4: Gradient Boosting Classifier.

2. multi_classifier: The performance of 3 different ML algorithms are compared to solve the multi-class classification problem. Algorithm 1: KNeighborsClassifier. Algorithm 2: SVC. Algorithm 3: GaussianNB.

3. regressor: The performance of 5 different ML algorithms are compared to solve the regression problem, this is, to predict the value of a continuous variable, in this case, it is the fuel consumption of a car. Algorithm 1: Lasso (Linear regressions with L1 regularization). Algorithm 2: Ridge (Linear regressions with L2 regularization). Algorithm 3: DecisionTreeRegressor. Algorithm 4: RandomForestRegressor. Algorithm 5: GradientBoostingRegressor.
